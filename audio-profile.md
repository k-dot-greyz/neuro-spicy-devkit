## The Philosophy

This is not just background music. This is the official System Audio Profile for the foundry - a curated set of frequencies designed to invoke the specific mental states required for the complex tasks of empire construction.

The audio environment is a tool, as essential as your IDE or terminal. Use it deliberately. Let the frequencies guide your cognitive state from initialization through deployment.

**Build empires. One frequency at a time.**
